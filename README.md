# Vehicle Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project develops a machine learning-based vehicle price prediction tool. The tool estimates the market value of a vehicle based on its key features such as manufacturing year, mileage, model type, and condition. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the tool automates the price prediction process, providing accurate and consistent price estimates. This model can be integrated into various online platforms, dealerships, and consumer applications to assist in making data-driven pricing decisions.

## Features
- **Accurate Price Prediction**: Estimates vehicle prices based on vehicle attributes.
- **Easy Integration**: The model can be integrated into online vehicle marketplaces and other platforms.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The web application is designed for easy and quick access to price predictions.

## Technologies Used
- **Machine Learning**: Regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor.
- **Flask**: Python framework used to serve the machine learning model in a web application.
- **Python Libraries**: 
  - `scikit-learn`: For training and evaluating the machine learning models.
  - `pandas` and `NumPy`: For data processing and manipulation.
  - `Pickle`: For saving the trained model for deployment.
